Known bugs:

n/a


Incomplete functionality:

n/a


Assumptions:
------------

-Assume user cannot fill every cell with a mine in minesweeper
hence why i set max mines at m*n-1

-Assume in minesweeper the 'try again' reprompts user for inputs again

-Assume the 80char limit only applies to code and not comments

-In the minesweeper try again, it is assumed 
if the user enters a value other than y, it will exit back to menu

Any other notes for the marker:
-------------------------------

As stated in the assignment specs, it is assumed translateNumber function 
works on letters that are entered by the user in uppercase

I have left debugging code comented out in the code
